Wiki Graph Instructions  (Directed Property Graph)

INPUTTING DATA (nodes & relations)

There are four node types: Person, Ideal, Entity, & Action.

There are four data files (corresponding to the four node types)
They hold the node & relation data:
person2.csv
ideal2.csv
entity2.csv
action2.csv

(The "2" part of the file is a temporary version distinction. No need for user to change it now.)

To add a new node, open the relevant data file. (e.g. person2.csv), and add the  row information you have. In the first, column be sure to add a unique node id, using the existing convention. (e.g. person 3, would entered as "P3" w/o quotes.)

ADDING RELATIONS

There are three types of relations so far:  Advisor, Board, & Support.
To add a new relation, open up the node file corresponding to "from" side of the relation. Find the approperiate column named Advisor, Board, & Support (with a first letter capitalized) Enter an existing node id for the "to" side of the relation. e.g. If person #3 was an Advisor to entity 4 (E4), you'd open the person2.csv file and add E4 to the Advisor column. (ids separated by spaces)

The current design allows optional relations in both directions, by adding the corresponding node ids in the two different files. e.g. Adding onto the first example relation above, to have entity #4 (E4) show an advisor relation to person #3 (P3), you'd open the entity2.csv file and add PS to the Advisor column. This increases the number of lines, but may be more robust to incomplete data entry, and speedup the searches. It also may lessen confusion of which side to use.

GENERATING GRAPH DATA FOR WIKI

The Wiki team has scripts to read the data files and generate a graph (JSON) that can be shown in Wiki.

DISPLAY GRAPH IN WIKI

Upload the graph json file. Use the Graph Viewer page. (ttp://xp.kelley.asia.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/recent-changes/view/graph-details/view/located-nodes/view/graph-viewer)

Use the four buttons "schema", "nodes", "map", & "cypher", to see various forms of the graph data. 

Hover over the graph nodes or relations to see more information.
