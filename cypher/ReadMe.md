# Cypher Query
We experiment with recursive descent parsing espressed as a hash of arrow functions.
Our emphasis will be on using pure javascript coded in the most direct and maintainable way.
We have considerable latatude in performance in that we will rarely parse anything more than a few hundred lines.

Initial results described here: https://github.com/WardCunningham/graph/pull/15
